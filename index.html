						<h3>OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</h3>
						<p>OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER has a boxed warning as follows:</p>
						<div class="box_warning_top"></div>
						<div class="box_warning">
							<p>WARNING: POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE, IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION AND LIMITATIONS OF USE</p>
							<p class="underline">Potential for Abuse</p>
							<p>OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER contains oxymorphone, which is a morphine-like opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance, with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics.</p> 
							<p>Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.</p>
							<p class="underline">Proper Patient Selection</p>
							<p>OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER is an extended-release oral formulation of oxymorphone indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.</p>
							<p class="underline">Limitations of Use</p>
							<p>OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER is NOT intended for use as an as needed analgesic.<br />OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER tablets are to be swallowed whole and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed. Taking cut, broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxymorphone.</p>
							<p>Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription medications containing alcohol, while on OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone.</p>
							<p></p>

							<h4>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h4>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>OPANA<sup>&reg;</sup> ER is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in patients with a known hypersensitivity to oxymorphone hydrochloride, morphine analogs such as codeine, or any of the other ingredients of OPANA ER; in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated such as: patients with respiratory depression (in the absence of resuscitative equipment or in unmonitored settings), acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, and in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.</p>
							</div>	
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>OPANA ER is not indicated for pain in the immediate post-operative period or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. OPANA ER is only indicated for post-operative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the post-operative pain is expected to be moderate or severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (see American Pain Society guidelines). OPANA ER is not indicated for pre-emptive analgesia (administration pre-operatively for the management of post-operative pain).</p>
							</div>
							<h4>WARNINGS</h4>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of OPANA ER, particularly in elderly or debilitated patients.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>OPANA ER should be administered with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Patients receiving other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may experience additive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>In the presence of head injury, the respiratory depressant effects of OPANA ER and the potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>OPANA ER may cause severe hypotension in patients with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Prolonged gastric obstruction may occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Use with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, as it may cause spasm of the sphincter of oddi.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Opioid analgesics, including OPANA ER, may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>OPANA ER is not recommended during labor and delivery, pregnancy, or nursing.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>OPANA ER should be used with caution in elderly and debilitated patients and in patients who are known to be sensitive to CNS depressants, such as those with cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease. OPANA ER should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment and in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. These patients should be started cautiously with lower doses of OPANA ER while carefully monitoring for side effects.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>OPANA ER tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Advise patients that OPANA ER tablets should be taken one at a time.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Advise patients not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet tablet prior to placing in the mouth.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Advise patients to take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in mouth.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Patients and their families should be instructed to flush any OPANA ER tablets that are no longer needed.</p>
							</div>
							<h4>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h4>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>Adverse reactions reported at (&ge;2%) in placebo-controlled trials were: nausea, constipation, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, headache, sweating increased, dry mouth, sedation, diarrhea, insomnia, fatigue, appetite decreased, and abdominal pain.</p>
							</div>	
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>In clinical trials there were several adverse events that were more frequently observed in subjects 65 and over compared to younger subjects. These adverse events included dizziness, somnolence, confusion, and nausea.</p>
							</div>
							<h4>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h4>
							<div class="bullet">
								<p>CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. OPANA ER should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p>
